# Salary Expectaion
this project implements a Salary Expectation Prediction Model using Linear Regression. The dataset consists of experience levels, job roles, and other relevant factors to predict expected salaries. The model is built using Python with scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and correlations
Model Training: Applying linear regression to predict salaries
Model Evaluation: Analyzing performance using RMSE and RÂ² score
Deployment: Optional Flask API for real-time predictions
